# Contributing to CaptainHook

Initial ideas are implemented as we want, but you can help us... We invite your participation through financial contributions, issues, and pull requests!

## Ways you can help

### Financial contributions

You can send us money and thereby retard the development. This money will go to full development and nowhere else. We appreciate your work and your care to us. At the moment you can send us to [PayPal](https://paypal.me/Dancebunny98).

### Contributing code

We do not refuse assistance from outside developers, if you know something in the area that we are ready to offer great ideas, then our doors are open. We are always ready to accept new members to our state. You can contact us through the contact form on the main page or by writing to us in the discord!

### Contributing documentation

As a member of our team, you can contribute to the development, but you have to take into account that all your changes can be seen by a regular user. Make sure your change is accurate, no need to rush. It is better to think over several times than to fix it many times.

### Helping others

Any user can help us with our problems. Periodically, we ask for help from users, and you can help us!

You can monitor [issues](https://github.com/Dancbeunny98/CaptainHookPublic/issues), and help other people who
have questions about contributing, or using it for their.
